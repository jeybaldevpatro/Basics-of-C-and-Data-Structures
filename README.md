## About This Repository

This repository contains programs and theory from CodeWithHarry’s Ultimate C Course.
All programs are written by me during the learning process and therefore include
common beginner mistakes that many new programmers make.

Conceptual explanations and theory are included to improve understanding.
Some improved solutions were created using ChatGPT and are clearly mentioned
so learners can differentiate them.

This repository also serves as my digital notes.
In the future, programs and theory from other C topics and data structures may be added.
